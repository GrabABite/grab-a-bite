#Deliverables
#A) Landmarks, orientation and scroll-spy
#Design a way to represent a user's progress through a long article, such that they can easily view the article's outline and move a desired portion of the document into the viewport at any time. An example of a "scrollspy" (see the "Table of Contents" in a desktop browser): https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/MoritzDornseifer/iot-cloud-enabled-alarm-clock-1e5119

#B) Carousel or tabbed component
Design a component that can guide a user though content that is split into multiple parts. The content may be controlled by the user, the component itself (a timer, perhaps), or other. The content may be of any type or medium (text content, images, videos, etc). An example of a slide deck style survey: http://thespeakerlab.typeform.com/to/mKgF8q

#C) Infinitely load content
#When a user reaches the bottom of a document, maintain the fluidity of the experience and engagement by loading new content. Ensure the user is made aware of new content (either upcoming, or already loading) and ensure a seamless, low-impact, responsible experience.

#Loading Animation
A loading animation will be implemented to show users of an upcoming content coming their way. (seamless gif; design accordance to the brand)
 
#Animation of new content entering
#Content entering from the right side of the page (0.5 milliseconds, fading in)

#D) One component or tool of your choosing
#Use your own experiences to design and develop a component or tool that will improve the experience of a user reading or viewing a website. Consider looking for inspirations on sites like Dribbble (or others) that demonstrate UI animations or related experience upgrades.
