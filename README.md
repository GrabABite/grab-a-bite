#Deliverables
#A) Landmarks, orientation and scroll-spy
#Design a way to represent a user's progress through a long article, such that they can easily view the article's outline and move a desired portion of the document into the viewport at any time. An example of a "scrollspy" (see the "Table of Contents" in a desktop browser): https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/MoritzDornseifer/iot-cloud-enabled-alarm-clock-1e5119

#B) Carousel or tabbed component
Design a component that can guide a user though content that is split into multiple parts. The content may be controlled by the user, the component itself (a timer, perhaps), or other. The content may be of any type or medium (text content, images, videos, etc). An example of a slide deck style survey: http://thespeakerlab.typeform.com/to/mKgF8q

#FINAL: we combined A & B, so a two in one scrollspy and carousel. The scroll-spy at the top of the page, to show the outline of the site and current page. The carousel has the flexibility to move anywhere using the scroll-spy.

#C) Infinitely load content
#When a user reaches the bottom of a document, maintain the fluidity of the experience and engagement by loading new content. Ensure the user is made aware of new content (either upcoming, or already loading) and ensure a seamless, low-impact, responsible experience.

#FINAL: three pictures per page to indicate there's something coming up next

#D) One component or tool of your choosing
#Use your own experiences to design and develop a component or tool that will improve the experience of a user reading or viewing a website. Consider looking for inspirations on sites like Dribbble (or others) that demonstrate UI animations or related experience upgrades.
